# Piano Learning Game

This project is an interactive game developed for a music education company (fictional) to assist beginner-level piano students in their studies. The game utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with DOM (Document Object Model) events to create a dynamic and engaging learning experience.

## Features

- **Interactive Piano Interface:** The project includes a virtual piano with keys that respond to user interactions.
- **Note Recognition:** The game provides exercises where users can identify and play specific notes on the virtual piano.
- **Scoring System:** Users receive instant feedback on their performance and earn points based on correct responses.
- **Level Progression:** As users master each level, they can unlock more challenging exercises to enhance their skills gradually.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web page, including the layout and the piano keys.
- **CSS:** Styling to make the interface visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript:** The core programming language for implementing game logic and DOM manipulation.
- **DOM (Document Object Model):** Events are used to capture user actions and update the interface dynamically.

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- **style.css:** The CSS file for styling the user interface.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file where the game logic is implemented, including DOM events handling.
